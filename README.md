# CNN implementation by hand
> Loïc Schüpbach

This implementation has been done during the machine learning course of the Master of Science in Information Science of the HEG.

Part of the code and the notebook is based on the course "CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" at Stanford University.

### Dataset
In this implementation, we use MNIST dataset. We load it with sklearn, so you should install it before.
